== Architectural documentation

Documentation of an IT project was historically very verbose (Technical specifications, Functional specifications, **T**echnical **A**rchitecture **D**ocument, etc.)

Yet, an IT project evolves fast, faster than these documents.
This documentation become rapidly outdated, and leads to confusion or bugs as some pieces of information are simply false?

However, documenting a project is necessary to pass on knowledge among changing stakeholders.

Hence, the objective is to write the minimum required to understand the context, and to hook this documentation up to code, as much as possible.

Thiw kind of documentation which has its roots in code is called living documentation, as it evolves naturally as the project does.

=== README

The README file, written in Markdown or AsciiDoc (like this course) is found at the root of a project / repository.
It is the gateway for an unknown project.

It answers the following questions:

* What is the use of this project ?
* How to use it ? (build tool, etc.)
* How to contact other stakeholders

Very popular in open-source projects, the README file is also important in a corporate context, since multiple projects coexists in the same information system and multiple teams must work together.

=== C4

*C4* is an approach for documenting the architecture, without mixing contexts.

The first thing needed, is a common vocabulary (as in DDD) with which all stakeholders *_understand_* each other.

This is a decisive step, which avoids lack of understanding afterward.

This vocabulary is used to draw the diagrams representing the project.

==== Context

The *_context_ diagram* allows to understand key features of the system [.underline]#without# displaying how the system is organized.

The system is represented by a unique shape (black box) which interacts with user personas or other systems.

The details (technologies, protocols, etc.) are irrelevant in this diagram, which should be understood by non-technical stakeholders.

==== Container

Once features are laid down, we can zoom in one notch with the  *_container_ diagram*

By _container_, we mean all system hosting code or data (application, database, broker, etc.).

This diagram reflects the "big-picture" architecture of the system and allow to see how [.underline]#responsibilities# are distributed among the different software pieces.

Can be represented:

* *Security* : networks, encoded traffic, traceability, etc.
* *Scalability* : load-balancers, (SPOF), etc.
* *Reliability* : backups, replicas, etc
* *Supervision* : probes, metric storage, IHM, etc.

==== Component

_Zooming_ in one more notch on each container is possible with the *_component_ diagram*.

This diagram details the composition of one container, with possible representation of:

* Intersecting features
* Business service
* Workflow

A component as a logical identity, one [.underline]#responsability#, and interacts with other components.

Here, implementation details and technical choices are relevant since these diagrams can be the most technical of a project.

==== Class

If necessary, we can go down more using the classic *UML _class_ diagram*.

Rarely useful if needs are clear and responsibilities well divided.

However to represent a complex behavior, this diagram can shine a light on a complex interaction between several objects.

=== ADR (Architectural Decision Records)

*ADR* are a log with each entry regarding a structuring choice made in the project architecture.

It is written by the software engineers and stored (most of the time) next to the code, in the same repository.

Reading this log allows to understand why and how an application was built this way.


Each entry is composed of:

* The date
* Involved stakeholders
* The context: what lead to this choice (security, organisational, performance issue, etc.)
* Different solutions considered
* The decision
* Expected consequences
* Optionally a state, which shows that the question was mentioned, analyzed, but that nothing came out of it

=== BDD and ATDD

**B**ehavior **D**riven **D**evelopment and **A**cceptance **T**est **D**riven **D**evelopment are two similar technics focused on describing the features in a way all stakeholders can understand them.
The result is often written in natural language (English, French, etc.) and uses unequivocal vocabulary.

This vocabulary is used to form sentences in different tests, which are associated to code.

These tests are [.underline]#*_executable_*# and _understood by all_.

As with the TDD, it is more a work management system than a testing technique.

The way these tests are constructed encourage composition and gives stakeholders a better independence and understanding.

BDD formalize how tests are written, with constraints similar to those of a _unit test_.
Sentences must start with:

* *Given* : initial conditions, zero, one, or more -> **[0..*]**
* *When* : triggering event, there must be one and only one -> **[1]**
* *Then* : assertions, there must be at least one -> **[1..*]**
