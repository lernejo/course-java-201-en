== Common architecture styles

Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

Everything has a cost, development itself is often the highest one.

Architecture choices should tend toward matching development cost and expected gain, hence it is strategic for a company.

Behind the mercantile facet, it is more pleasant to add new features on top of a good code base, rather than waiting for another team to deploy a new version of some API our team needs, or even be buried under constant bug-bashing.

Architecture decisions are relevant in the context of development iterations, in order to focus energy on added value at the time being.

=== N-tier

N-tier architecture divides an application into technical layers.

For a simple application (HTTP API on one side, some database on the other for example), we often find *3* tiers:

* The [.underline]#Controller# layer, responsible for
** HTTP transport
** Securing the access (Authentication and Authorization)
** Serializing and deserialize data into _anemic_ objects (**D**ata **T**ransfer **O**bject)
** Performing surface validation, particularly on received data structure

* The [.underline]#Service# layer, responsible for
** Supplying high-level business features to _controllers_, so no business logic leak into this other layer
** Ensuring data consistency, in regard to _business rules_
** (Handle transactions , if the database is transactional)

* The [.underline]#Persistence# layer (aka _repositories_, or **D**ata **A**ccess **O**bjects), responsible for
** Communicating with the database
** Serializing and deserialize data into _anemic_ objects (**D**ata **T**ransfer **O**bject or entities)
** Translate database technical errors to be handled by a business rule in the _service_ layer

This architecture style is often applied as-is to the entire code base, and brings confusion when it comes to understanding the different business domains.

It would be preferable to introduce a division _matching_ business domains

That way, understanding of the key domains of an application is simpler, and it avoids to mix by mistake components between domains.

Furthermore, code can still be divided in technical layers inside each domain.

=== Hexagonal

*Hexagonal architecture* aim for dividing _business code_ from _technical code_.

The division isolates the application _core_, from the _adapters_ which link _business code_ to the outside world, _machine-to-machine_ communication (HTTPS, AMQP, etc.), or _human-to-machine_ (GUI, email, SMS, etc.)

The objectives are as follow:

* Maintain a low coupling between technical stakes and business rules
* Simplify tests on the _business code_, since there is no framework or library involved
* Allow to replace one _adapter_, without modifying the rest of the application

Some vocabulary:

* *API* (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) an interface which is [.underline]#implémented by the business code#, and called by an adapter
* *SPI* (**S**ervice **P**rovider **I**nterface) an interface which is called by the business code, and [.underline]#implemented by an adapter#.

Development starts by writing the business code of a feature.
This code must not use any dependency to a framework or library.
To this end, this code can be isolated in a dedicated module so that the compilation can enforce this no-dependency rule.

Afterwards, other modules can be added for adapters, these modules having a dependency to the core one.

=== Monolith vs micro-services

[quote, Simon Brown, @simonbrown]

I’ll keep saying this... if people can’t build monoliths properly, microservices won’t help.
____

Building a monolith is creating one only application to handle all features.

In a monolith, modularize the code to isolate parts of the code that must not interact with each other is vital.

If not followed, the risk is to see an exponential growth of the complexity emerging at each feature addition.

On the other hand, the micro-service architecture style forces a kind of division, as micro-services must not depend (in terms of code) to each other.
L’approche micro-service a ceci de différent que les différents domaines sont gérés par des applications différentes.
As it is still possible to share code trough the use of shared libraries, domain isolation, as in a monolith, is essential.
The rule that expresses this concern the most is that each micro-service must have (if needed) its own database / data persistence model.

The same way, if micro-services must communicate, using asynchronous communication will avoid time-related coupling.

A micro-services architecture has downsides:

* Multiple applications must be deployed at a fast pace
[unstyled]
** -> Delivery and deployment must be robust and automated
* Issue investigation is more complex, as a single user action can be spread across multiple applications
[unstyled]
** -> Logs must be unique, informative and centralized
** -> A correlation mechanism is needed (correlation-id header, via header, APM, etc.)
* The infrastructure cost is higher

And upsides:

* The code of one micro-service is smaller, simpler
* Micro-services can evolve independently of each other, and be maintained by different teams
* Micro-services can scale separately from each other
[unstyled]
** -> If the _product_ domain of an e-commerce website is under more load than the _payment_ one, it is possible to dispatch more resources to the one needing it
