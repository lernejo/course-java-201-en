== Conclusion

To the contrary of what french industry tries to make us believe, being a software architect is not a job separated from being a developer.

Architectural questions must be handled by the development team, each one having its own experience and interest to a specific matter.

It is the job of [.underline]#software engineers# to think about the consequences of their doing, as they will face them anyway, once the product is in production.

Software architecture, as for technology monitoring, is an integral part of the tools portfolio of the developer.
