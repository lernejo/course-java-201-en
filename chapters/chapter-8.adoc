=== Centralized log management

In order to simplify the process of searching some event in log files, it is important to centralized them.

This means send them in the same place, whether it be:

* A file system, in which the `grep` command can be used
* _ElasticSearch_, _Loki_ or equivalent, in which logs can be queried
* A SAAS solution whose job it is (_Datadog_, _Logz.io_, etc.)

Logs must be obvious and provide the maximum information possible.
This is why visual visual logging or _debug_ events must not be sent to such systems.

==== The Elastic stack

The most popular solution of log centralization (among others) is the _Elastic_ one: *ELK* (**E**lasticSearch, **L**ogstash, **K**ibana).
Each of its component can be replaced by another tool, and the chain can be more complex to handle scaling, but the structure, nevertheless, stay the same.

* *Logstash* slices log lines into structured documents (JSON) and send them to *ElasticSearch*
* *ElasticSearch* indexes them and supply an API to query these indexes
* *Kibana* is a web interface to create dashboards and search arbitrary data
