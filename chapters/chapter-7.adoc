Log _files_ contain all information needed to diagnose issues.
These information can also bu used to build metrics for supervising the system.
Logs are often the sole source of the event chronology and are especially important in high traffic applications where finding the issue of a particular user can seem like looking for a needle in a haystack.

=== Log libraries

On the app side, there are many library to help write log events.

Just in the Java ecosystem, we can find:

* JUL (**J**ava **U**til **L**ogging) minimalist, supplied by the JDK
* Apache JULI (**J**ava **U**til **L**ogging **I**nterface)
* Apache Commons Logging
* Apache Log4J
* JBoss Logging
* Logback
* etc.

We find in these various tools common concepts:

* Low coupling between the component that collects log events (`Logger`) and the one which write them outside the system (`Appender`)
* Configuration outside the code (file, system properties, etc.)
* Severity levels:
** *DEBUG* : use during the development phase, invisible once the application is deployed
** *INFO* : information about an event in the system (state change, or reaction to an outside trigger)
** *WARN* : an error happened, the system did not behave as expected, but no manual intervention is immediately needed
** *ERROR* : an error happened, a human intervention is required to fix the system

[NOTE]
====
A business error is not necessarily a technical error.
For example: a user entering the wrong password is a normal business case, handled in the code, and the matching event (if recorded) is of *INFO* level.
====

==== SLF4J architecture

The issue with having this many tools for writing log is that the ecosystem is mixed.

* Tomcat uses *JUL* through the *JULI* abstraction
* Spring uses *Apache Commons Logging*.
* *HBase* official client uses *Log4j*.
* Etc.

One application,using different frameworks and libraries, should then configure each of these _logging_ libraries in a consistent way (same event format, files, retained severity, etc.).

It would be not only annoying, but also error prone (race condition on the same file, configuration oversight, etc.).

However, *SLF4J* was designed to unify all these tools.

*SLF4J* is made of:

* An *_abstract API_* forming a unique facade for various but common logging features
* *_Adapters_* between this API and existing log libraries
* *_Bridges_*, libraries having the same binary compatibility (same qualified class names, same method signatures) as existing log libraries, but redirecting calls to the *_abstract API_*

Using *SLF4J* means redirecting all logs to this *_abstract API_* and send them one unique implementation.

Configuration is then done once.

==== MDC (Mapped Diagnostic Context)

The *MDC* is a tool supplied by many log libraries which allows to transport information in a same thread.

The goal is to enhance event information with common data as they are available, without having to pass them as parameters in each methods.

Consider this code:

.File MyController.java
[source,java]
----
class MyController {

    private final MyService service;

    public User newUser(User user, @Header("correlationId") String correlationId) {
        return service.newUser(user, correlationId);
    }
}
----

.File MyService.java
[source,java]
----
class MyService {

    private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyService.class);
    private final MyRepository repository;

    public User newUser(User user, String correlationId) {
        if(isValid(user, correlationId)) {
            return repository.save(user, correlationId);
        } else {
            throw new InvalidUserException();
        }
    }

    private boolean isValid(User user, String correlationId) {
        if(user.age > 110) {
            logger.info("[" + correlationId + "] Invalid User: too old");
            return false;
        } else if(user.age < 1) {
            logger.info("[" + correlationId + "] Invalid User: too young");
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
----

The `correlationId` variable is systematically passed because it is required to log it each time, allowing later reconciliation of multiple events matching the same user trigger.

It is a good fit for the *MDC* use:

.File MyController.java
[source,java]
----
class MyController {

    private final MyService service;

    public User newUser(User user, @Header("correlationId") String correlationId) {
        MDC.put("correlationId", correlationId);
        return service.newUser(user);
    }
}
----

.File MyService.java
[source,java]
----
class MyService {

    private final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(MyService.class);
    private final MyRepository repository;

    public User newUser(User user) {
        if(isValid(user)) {
            return repository.save(user);
        } else {
            throw new InvalidUserException();
        }
    }

    private boolean isValid(User user) {
        if(user.age > 110) {
            logger.info("Invalid User: too old");
            return false;
        } else if(user.age < 1) {
            logger.info("Invalid User: too young");
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
----

MDC variables we want to appear should then be configured in the output format.

.File logback.xml
[source,xml]
----
<configuration>

  <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
    <encoder>
      <pattern>%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - [%X{correlationId}] %msg%n</pattern> <!--1-->
    </encoder>
  </appender>

  <root level="DEBUG">
    <appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />
  </root>
</configuration>

<1> Pattern used to write events in the console

=== GC logs

Causes of an issue can be technical, and related to the **G**arbarge **C**ollector.

So it is important to enable its logs, using a flag when starting the JVM:

`-Xlog:gc=debug:file=gc.log:pid,time,uptimemillis:filecount=5,filesize=1M`

In this example, the JVM will write GC events of minimal *debug* severity in file named *gc.log* (with a rotation on 5 files maximum of 1M each) with additional information: PID (processus ID), time and execution duration.

More options here: https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/158

[.underline]#Alternately#, metrics collection tools like *Micrometer* can export these information to time-series ingesting systems, such as *Graphite*, *Warp10* or *Prometheus*.

=== Heap Dump
When the JVM stops unexpectedly, this can be due to an **O**ut **O**f **M**emory error, and the investigation can be done using a *Heap Dump*.

A *Heap Dump* is the projection in a file of the memory state of the JVM.

This flag needs to be added when starting the JVM, so that such a file is produced in case of a crash:

`-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`

Produced files can be analyzed with tools such as *Eclipse MAT* (free) or *JProfiler* (licensed).
