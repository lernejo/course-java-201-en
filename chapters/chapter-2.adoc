== Low coupling, a target at each scale

[quote,some architect passing by]
I answered their issue by offering to add a new layer of indirection.

In most situations, the most important objective is *maintainability*, as software is built to last for a long time.
In case of an issue, link to performance, security, or normal operation, the solution must aim to have the minimum impact.
Bigger is the code change, bigger is the risk to broke something else and longer is the time before deploying the change.
A fix or an evolution, must have the least risk possible.

Reducing the time between the design of a new feature and its delivery to production, is increasing the mastery and confidence of the team producing code the code.

=== At a Java class scale

==== Example 1: Internal state vs public contract

Consider this class:

.File TrafficLight.java
[source,java]
----
class TrafficLight {

    private int color;

    public void setColor(int newColor) {
        this.color = newColor;
    }

    public int getColor() { // <1>
        return color;
    }
}
----

<1> Changing the type of internal state representation (`int`) will need to adapt the code using this class

The class could be rewritten to [.underline]#uncouple#:

* the internal state, represented by an `int`
* the `public` contract (API) callable by other classes

.File TrafficLight.java
[source,java]
----
class TrafficLight {

    private int color;

    public Color nextState() {
        color = (color + 1) % 3;
        return Color.values()[color];
    }

    public enum Color {
        GREEN,
        ORANGE,
        RED,
    }
}
----

==== Example 2: Positional coupling of parameters

Consider this interface:

.File PersonRepository.java
[source,java]
----
interface PersonRepository {

    void savePerson(String firstname, String lastname, int birthYear, int birthMonth);
}
----

When calling this method, one may invert one parameter with another of the same type without noticing it.
Here the compilation will not help detect a bug, where month and year are inverted for example.
This is called _positional coupling_.
A better design could be:

.File PersonRepository.java
[source,java]
----
interface PersonRepository {

    Person savePerson(Person person);

    @RecordBuilder // <1>
    record Person(String firstname, String lastname, YearMonth birthMonth) {}
}
----

<1> The *io.soabase.record-builder:record-builder* library is used to generate the matching _builder_

It is now harder to make a mistake:

[source,java]
----
Person person = PersonBuilder.builder()
    .firstname("Bobby")
    .lastname("Singer")
    .birthMonth(YearMonth.of(1962, Month.DECEMBER))
    .build();

repository.savePerson(person);
----

==== Example 3: Public contract extracted in an interface

The point of using interfaces is to uncouple the public contract from the concrete implementation.
This allows to:

* Substitute one type by another (implementing the same interface) without modifying the calling code
* Hide the implementation (methods and fields missing from the interface) from the calling code

The `Logger` concept, widely used in IT, is an abstraction to send events _somewhere_.
From the perspective of the business code, it does not matter where events are sent.

This abstraction is an interface, for example:

.File Logger.java
[source,java]
----
interface Logger {

    void log(Level level, String message);

    enum Level {
        INFO,
        WARNING,
        ERROR,
        ;
    }
}
----

And can be used this way:

[source,java]
----
record CoffeeShop(CoffeeMaker coffeeMaker, Logger logger) {

    public Cup makeCoffee(String firstname) {
        if(!coffeeMaker.isReady()) {
            logger.log(Level.WARN, "Tried to make some coffee, but the coffee maker is not ready yet");
            return Cup.EMPTY;
        }
        Cup cup = new Cup(firstname);
        coffeeMaker.pourIn(cup);
        logger.log(Level.INFO, "Made coffee for " + firstname + ", careful itâ€™s hot !");
        return cup;
    }
}
----

Using an implementation of `Logger` which writes in

* The standard output
* A file
* A database
* A message broker
* A composition of all of the above

will not change the code of the `CoffeeShop` class.

==== Various forms of coupling

Various forms of coupling can be found here: https://connascence.io/

Most of couplings can be avoided by using the code at the moment of its creation.
The simplest technic is follow the *TDD* (Test Driven Development) principles.

Practicing *TDD* involves writing a _minimalist_ test before writing the _minimalist_ production code that makes it pass.
Code written this way, strictly meeting test requirements, is by design easily usable (as already used in tests).


[quote, Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin, Three laws of TDD]
____
1) Write [.underline]#NO# production code except to pass a failing test
2) Write only [.underline]#enough# of a test to demonstrate a failure
3) Write only [.underline]#enough# production code to pass the test
____

Writing _minimalist_ tests is very important, as we want, when practicing *TDD*, shorten to the maximum the feedback loop between phases:

=== At an application scale

==== Business low coupling
An application uses most of the time distinct business domains.

For example, in an e-commerce application, we find catalog management, product sheet, cart detail, payment, invoicing, etc.

These domains are connected, but can evolve separately from each others.
Code must express these connections, but also the self-sufficiency.
A modification in the cart detail code will not (or should not) need another modification in the payment code.

Maintaining a low coupling between applicative components reduce the risk of introducing a bug in case of a change.

==== Technical low coupling
The same way, splitting business code (containing business rules) and technical code is a good approach.
What is meant by _technical code_ is code needed to connect to the outside world, typically by way of an

* API
* Graphical user interface
* Connection to a message broker
* Connection to a database
* etc.

The core code of an application can be built without any framework or library in order to simplify tests and reduce the business code to its simplest form.

_Connectors_ can later on be wired to it, to bridge business rules to other systems of users.

One of these approach is [.underline]#hexagonal architecture#, which will be detailed in the next chapters.

=== At an information system scale

In an information system, multiple applications, maintained by distinct teams must exchange data.

Architectural decisions choosen at this scale must consider the objectives previously enumerated (Maintainability, Testability, etc.) as well as the human factor.

Teams working on different applications are made of men and women with different work habits, rhythms and technical maturity.

It is necessary to consider these elements to protect the quality of service and simplify interactions between teams.

==== Example 1: asynchronous communication

Consider an application under heavy but irregular traffic, as a website performing mortgage simulations which is mainly used between 12 P.M. and 2 P.M.

image::mortgage_system_http.png[align=center]

The public website gathers simulation requests and sends them to an internal service which perform these tasks:

* Connect periodically to external APIs of various banks to maintain fresh data for computation
* Compute the simulations (we imagine them slow for the sake of the demonstration) based on user request information
* Send back simulation results to the public website

Even with a low traffic, a service interruption of a few minutes can damage the business, by loosing customers or visibility.

However with a synchronous communication between the public website and the internal service, an update of the latter will _de facto_ lead to the public website service interruption or data loss.

In this case, it is relevant to switch the communication model to an asynchronous one, through a message broker which will buffer user requests.
Thus, no service interruption will be _visible_ and no data will be be lost.

==== Example 2: spread the load

Following on from the same mortgage application, consider that the message broker is coupled to the internal service for legacy reasons.

image::mortgage_system_bad_bad_jms.png[align=center]

Sending a lot of events all at once (water hammer) to such a system could reduce its performance, or even crash it.

In this case, it could be simpler to have the publishing application to spread the load (_throttling_), to avoid the pressure coupling between the two applications.

Setting up this kind of mechanism requires to define a maximum speed (in messages/sec for example).
It can be built using different solutions, such as:

* Periodically read the X oldest messages in a database (be careful however, batch systems are difficult to scale)
* A small dedicated application using off-memory state (database, to be able to simply scale if needed)
* Using some brokers functionalities
