Collecting logs and metrics is the ground on which supervision is built.

On this, we add components to refine data into:

* Alerts, triggered when an abnormal behavior is detected
* Dashboards, to investigate an issue, find correlations and converge on the issue origin

Supervision is the tool that allows to follow the system state, understand its operation and even predict its use.

[TIP]
====
Beware to only keep relevant data in such systems, as it can grow very fast and it can become tricky to navigate in the significant amount of data.

The end product is built with the help of these three questions:

* What are the behavior of the system identified as abnormal? (unavailable service, high resource usage, etc.)
* What system behavior do we want to understand? (water hammer, external service unavailability, etc.)
* Where to put the probes that will generate necessary metrics ?

Tools for document indexation, storage of time-series or databases, all are information source that can be leveraged to build dashboards and alerts.

Today, the most popular choice among open-source tools for aggregating such data is Grafana.
