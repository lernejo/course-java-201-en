APIs can be documented in two ways:

* *Contract First* : the API specification is written (OpenAPI, RAML, WSDL, etc.) first, then the matching code is written or generated.
If the code is generated, there always is a manual step to wire it to the business code.

* *Code First* : the code is written first.
This code can be enhanced with metadata of the API (description, explanations for each error codes, etc.)
The documentation is then generated based on the code, particularly with the emergence of *OpenAPI* (formerly Swagger) and various tools in its ecosystem.
Such a documentation evolves as code does.

The *code first* approach is the most durable, as it avoids a drift between documentation and code to grow over time.

In any case, modifying an API must be taken carefully, as it may lead to breaking changes for end users (and this can have business consequences).

Some changes have no consequences:

* Add a new field in a response
* Remove an optional field from a request

-> _What do the most can also do the least_.

Other changes, have consequences:

* Delete a field from a response
* Add a mandatory field in a request

And will lead to communication errors and needs to be operated differently.

In the case of a change with breaking changes is needed, it must be introduced with a new version of the API, while maintaining the old version.

This way, customers have the time to operate the necessary change of code on their side to use the new version.
When all customers hav moved on to the new version, the previous one can be deleted.

This approach introduces a *_low coupling_* between systems allowing them to evolve at different paces.
